C# GUI created for my first Technical Internship (2 months).

It consisted in the repurpose of a CNC machine into a system able to automatically pick up ASICs, put them on a test board, run a test program, and sort them depending on the result of the test.
The GUI does the Human-Machine interaction, by dynamicaly generating the G-Code to be sent to the machine and managing the communication with the Arduino cards.
Basic watchdogs were also implemented.
